    "Q1. What is multiprocessing in python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS=Multiprocessing is a Python module that allows multiple processes to run concurrently, utilizing multiple CPUs or cores. It enables developers to create parallel processing applications in Python, which can improve the performance of CPU-bound tasks significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiprocessing module provides a way to spread out computation across multiple CPUs or cores, by creating separate Python processes that can run independently from each other. This means that different parts of a program can be executed simultaneously, allowing for faster execution times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing can be particularly useful when working with large datasets, performing complex calculations, or when running CPU-intensive tasks. By using multiprocessing, these tasks can be distributed across multiple cores, reducing the overall proces\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What are the differences between multiprocessing and multithreading?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS=Resource utilization: Multiprocessing creates separate processes, each with their own memory space and Python interpreter, while multithreading creates multiple threads within a single process, all sharing the same memory space and interpreter. This means that multiprocessing can utilize multiple CPUs or cores more efficiently, while multithreading may struggle to fully utilize all available resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency management: Since multiprocessing creates separate processes, each process can run independently of each other without the need for synchronization. In contrast, multithreading requires careful management of shared resources, such as locks or semaphores, to ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory management: Multiprocessing creates separate memory spaces for each process, which can help to reduce memory usage and avoid issues with memory leaks. In contrast, multithreading shares the same memory space, which can lead to issues with memory management and synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming complexity: Multiprocessing requires additional code to manage communication and coordination between processes, while multithreading can be more straightforward since all threads share the same memory space. This means that multiprocessing can be more complex to implement but can also provide better performance for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, multiprocessing and multithreading are two different techniques used to achieve parallelism in programming. While multiprocessing can utilize multiple CPUs or cores more efficiently and avoid issues with concurrency and memory management, it requires additional code to manage communication and coordination between processes. On the other hand, multithreading can be more straightforward to implement but may struggle to fully utilize all available resources and requires careful management of shared resources.\n",

    "We then start the new process using the start() method and wait for it to complete using the join() method. Finally, we print a message to indicate that the main process has completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the if __name__ == '__main__': statement is used to ensure that the code inside it is only executed when the script is run as the main program, and not when it is imported as a module. This is a common practice when working with the multiprocessing module in Python.\n",

    "Q4. What is a multiprocessing pool in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS=A multiprocessing pool in Python is a way to create a pool of worker processes that can be used to parallelize the execution of a function across multiple inputs or tasks. It is a useful tool for distributing a large amount of work across multiple processors or cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pool of processes is created using the multiprocessing.Pool class, and each process in the pool is available to execute tasks in parallel. The pool can be used to apply a function to a set of inputs, where each input is processed by a separate process in the pool. The results of each computation are collected and returned to the calling process.\n",
